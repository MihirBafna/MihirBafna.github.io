<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Computer Science major at [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) in the BSMS program specializing in the [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/intelligence) and [Theory](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/theory) threads.

My research interests lie at the intersection of [machine learning](), [structural biology](), and [drug discovery](), specifically with generative modeling. In past projects, I focused on applying graph representation learning techniques (GNNs) to investigate cell and gene regulatory interactions from single cell and spatial transcriptomics data.

I am fortunate to have been advised by Dr. [Xiuwei Zhang](https://xiuweizhang.wordpress.com/) at Georgia Tech and Dr. [Jian Ma](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jianma/) at CMU.
