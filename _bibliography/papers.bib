  abstract={We consider the problem of identifying viral reads in human host genome data. When the viral
family is highly diverged, sequence based methods have low sensitivity, and domain specific training
is needed to recognize the viral reads. We show first that Deep convolutional neural networks, that
model the problem as one of supervised classification, also have reduced sensitivity in this ‘open-set’
testing scenario. Next, we present DeepViFi, which uses deep learning on a transformer architecture
to learn high-dimensional representations of viral reads from short-read whole genome sequence data.
At 90% precision, DeepViFi achieved 90% recall compared to 15% for other deep learning methods.
Our results suggest that DeepViFi provides a framework for rapidly learning of representations from
families without specific domain knowledge, a fast test for quickly and accurately identifying the
target sequences in a larger data-set.}
